# Metaolive

This repository hosts data and scripts created by me (Eugenio Parente) for 
the "METAOLIVE: meta-omic approaches for traditional table olive fermentation" 
project (more [here](http://web.unibas.it/parente/?page_id=1945)). 
This project is co-funded by Ministero dell’Università e della Ricerca PRIN 2022, 
proposal 2022NN28ZZ, and received funding from the European Union 
Next-GenerationEU - PIANO NAZIONALE DI RIPRESA E RESILIENZA (PNRR).
* olive_FMBN contains scripts and data with phyloseq objects (and their metadata; 
including an extra_metadata file with further metadaa for bacgterial samples) 
on olive fermentations extracted from [FoodMicrobionet v5](https://github.com/ep142/FoodMicrobionet). 
Data for bacteria have been used in a poster presented at the [Food Systems Microbiomes](https://foodsystemsmicrobiomes.org) 
conference and at the AJLAB meeting, on 9/8/2024.
