# Metaolive

This repository hosts data and scripts created by me (Eugenio Parente) for the "METAOLIVE: meta-omic approaches for traditional table olive fermentation" project (more [here](http://web.unibas.it/parente/?page_id=1945)). This project is co-funded by Ministero dell’Università e della Ricerca PRIN 2022, proposal 2022NN28ZZ, and received funding from the European Union Next-GenerationEU - PIANO NAZIONALE DI RIPRESA E RESILIENZA (PNRR).
* olive_FMBN contains a script and data with phyloseq objects (and their metadata) on olive fermentations extracted from FoodMicrobionet v4.2.1. Note that this version of FoodMicrobionet is unplublished and will be made available soon on Zenodo and Mendeley data and in the FoodMicrobionet repository.
